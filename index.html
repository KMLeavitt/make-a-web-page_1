  <b>HTML</b>:
  <br>
~It is the heart of the Web
  <br>
~Stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>
  <br>

  <br>
~Made of:<br>

<b>HTML Markup, HTML Attributes, White space, Inline/Block:</b>
 <br>
~HTML is made up of <em>tags</em>
<p>
  b = bold; em = italics; a = anchor (used for making links); a href = putting a website as a link; img = Image; img src = putting the image on page; src + href are attributes and there can be multiple ones making up a whole tag; br = breaks text; p = paragraph; div = divide the text.
</p>
<span>Inline just breaks the text from where you put the br; Block puts the text that is inbetween the two div  into a block in which you can manipulate the height and width.</span>

<b> Document Object Model:</b>
<p>The Document Object Model (DOM), is the "tree like structure" of the page.It shows where one command branchs out into more specific and detailed commands for the computer to follow. It turns the tags on a page into elements in a "tree".</p>
</div>
  <br>
<div class="Note1">
<b>HTML and CSS in DOM:</b>
<p>HTML and CSS are both types of languages used in coding. HTML controls the structure of the page. CSS controls the style of the page.</p>
</div>
  <br>
<div class="Note">
  <b>Boxes:</b>
<p>Everything on a webpage or anything that has to do with coding is a <em>box!</em> It doesn't matter if a bubble on a webpage looks like a circle it started out as a box, and then coding made it specified to look like a circle. On a webpage there will be boxes, inside boxes, inside boxes.This has to do with images, borders, buttons, and links to other pages. Even if it doesn't look like a box don't let it fool you, it is.</p>

<b>CSS:</b>
 <br>
~CSS stands for "<b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heets"
 <br>
 <br>
<div> Until code is written and specified to a certain section, that section will look the same and have the same code as the other sections, until told otherwise.
</div>
<p> The entire tag of a CSS is called a "declaration". The code written in front of the colon (:) is called the "Property" and the code written behind the colon (:) but infront of the semicolon (;) is called "Value".</p>
